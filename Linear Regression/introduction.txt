1) about normal distribution 
2) correlation 
3) Linear Regression (ml) 


correlation is defining relationship between two variable 
if one variable increases the same time another variable also increses 
called positive correlation 

perfect coorelation is not possible 
so our data can be into high or low correlation possible (in both situation)
1)perfect positive correlation is 1 
2)perfect negative correlation is -1 
3)no correlation will be 0 
and high and low can be near 0 to near positive 1 or negative -1 



calculate correlation of given data correlation

if my data is  correlated and data is in continuous type then i can use 
Linear regression Machine learning algorithm to predict icecream sale 

so i can if ice cream sale increases when temp increses thne sale is dependent and temp is independet variable 
this kind of correlation help me to predict my ice cream sale business 


i invested to do advertisment of my product 
when i invest 2000 in a week i got business 3200
when i invest 3000 in a week i got business 6000

i can say investing money into advertisment help me to get more business 
and now i want to calculate ROI of my business on based of investment i have done 
on advertisement 

return of investment known as rOI 

social 	i
newspaper 
TV channel

how much business you getting 
first you have your previous data 
so we took your previous data and then those data we will give to machine learning model

if i want to do prediction on continuous data and my data is correlated then i can use machine learning 
linear regression to predict ROI 


so in linear regression we need a regression line 
which is also known as best fit line 
so if i give some input for investment whatever point will come on that line 
will give prediction of Y or ROI of our investment 

SO to make this prediction line or regression line 
we have some formula 

	which help us to make best fit line as per our data becasue 
	all time we can have diff diff type of data 


Temp   sales 
X      Y

there is only one independet variable but if i want to predict house price then 
above is example of linear regression 


sqft	facility  area	  Y 
x1	x2	  x3	  price



when we have multiple independet variable to predict price of something Y at that time we can use 
Multiple regresion 


when our data is nor correlated but in that situation also we wants to 
do prediction on our continuous data then 
we can go for polynomial regresion line 
where our best fit line will be curvey 



linear regression :- 
when data is continuous and data is correlated 
1) single linear regression (1 independent and 1 dependent) icecream sale
2) multiple linear regression  (more than 1 independet 1 dependent) house price 

here regression line will be straight 

when data is not correlated and still we wants to perform regression on continuous values 
we can use 
3)polynomial regression 

here regression line will be curvey 

yhat=theta1x + theta0 (Data science formula 

y= mx+b (maths formula)

m is slop 
b is intercept 
x is independet variable 
y is prediction data point for given x 


above formula will create best fit line 
by reducing mean square error 



*****************************************
normal distribution 
standard score or standered normal distribution helps us to find how much our each data is deviated from original mean 
and give standered score of deviation ofeach observation 

*********************************************
correlation 

correlation is a process when one variable value we change we can see change into dependet variable also 
this means this two variable are correlated with each other 

correlation is base of linear regression 
there are 2 type of linear regression avaiable 
	1)single linear regression 
	2)multiple linear regression 

regression helps us to do predication it is statastics model to do prediction on correlated data 

but some time if my data is continuous and not correlated then also i want to perform 
regressio then i have to use polynomial regression which is part of regression family 


so we can say there are 3 type of regression we can perform 
1)single linear regression 
2)multiple linear regression 
3)polynomial regression 

when terminology comes linear then we make 
best fit line which is give prediction for our independet data 
on based of previous experiance 

this best fit line is developed using MEan Squre error 
formula 

to develop best fit line we have 
formula like 
y=mx+b 

y is prediction point 
m is slop 
x is independet variable 
b is interecept 

we can also write same formula like 
yhat=theta1x+theta0 

yhat is prediction point line 
theta1 is slop 
theta0 is intercept 
x is independet variable 




























































there are 3 type regression
when data is in correlation 
	1)Linear regression 
	2)multiple regression 
when data is not correlated 
	3) polynomial regression
