Data analysis 
	pandas 
	numpy
	matplotlib 
and we analys our data and find insights from it 
to do this process we use data Preprocessisng becasue 
machine learning algorithm can except data into numeric form only 
and also if we have some null value or missing value treatments we have to do 
along with we have convert our categorical data into numeric data 

this entier process is known as exploratory Data analysis 
which have total 12 process 








****************Machine Learning*******************\
process where we want that machine learn something on previous data 
and after that on the based of experiance if machine 
works that process is known as machine learning 

like human we first learn something and then we experiment that 
experiance with realife exaclty same thing if i want from machine 
that is possible 

as we know 1950 Alan Turing first time intriduce that machine 
can also learn and it can mimic like human 

1)Superwised machine learning 
2)unsuperwised machine learning 
 
3)semi superwise machine learning (Deep learning) 
	reinforcement algorthim (feedback algorithm)

1) Superwised Machine learning 
	
	1) Regression (contineuos) Descriptive statastics 
	2) classification (for categorical data) probability 

superwised machine learning means at time of training a model 
we have input and output both things 

*********house price data **************
as a data analyst i have given data which input and output feature 
sqft => input feature independet variable 
price => output feature dependent variable 

i want to make machine learning model which predicts house price then 
here we required regression of superwised machine learning 
where i will divide my data into 2 parts 
Training : 80% i will use for training my model 
Testing  : 20% i will use to test my model 

machine learning algorithm will select training and testing data set 
with random mechanisum 

sqft	price    
250	200000     training

380     400000     testing 

450     700000     training
500     800000     training
700     1000000    training 
1000    1500000    training 
1200    1300000    training 

5000    4500000    testing 

now i want to predict if sqft is 850 then what will be house price ? 
above problem i can say that is regression problem where 
we wants to predict output of given input 

once training done machine learning model will take randomaly testing 
data input and find output of it after that it will compare 
original output and predicted output machine learning model can 
predict approximate output and if that predicted output is near to 
original output that means your machine learning model is good to 
do predictions in regression probel statements 

after that as user i can give some input and then it will be 
able to give prediction on it 
so here 
after training and testing if i give 
850 sqft then it will give approx predicted price for house to me 

above was example of superwised machine learning regression algo 
type of regressions 
1)linear regression
2)multiple regresion
3)polynomial regression 


******************************************************************
	classification algo 
******************************************************************
used when we want output in some category 
either email is spam or not 
either mouse is obease or not 
either customer continue or not 

all above are known as binary clasifiers becasue we check onle 
0 or 1 

if mail is spam then 1 
if mail is not spam  0

when we want to clasify our data into 2 category then that is known as 
binary classifiers 
naive bayes classifiers 
logistic regression 

multiple classifiers 
1) Decision Tree 
2) SVM (Support vector machine)
3) K-nearest neighbour
 
here also while training model we have 
input (independent variable)
output (dependent variable)

lbs	month
weight	age	state

training 
3	1	obease
2.5	2	not obease 

Testing
4	2	obease
5	3	obease 


weight and age is independt variable 
on based of weight and age with state we find probability 
if foundt age is less and weight high that means mouse is obease 


another example multiple classifiers 

age	gender 		game application 
12	m		ludo
15	m		ludo 
20	f		candy crush 
25	f		candy crush 
20	m		pubG
25	m		pubG
35	m		pubG
40	m		pubG
13	f		uno
14	f		uno


32 m  pubG

21 f  candy crush 

13 m ludo 
	
	if 
	age > 15 
  gender      gender 
  m	    m          F
 ludo 	    pubG     candy crush 

above example is for decision tree 

categorical that time we need to classification 
continuous we need to regression

here we will get only input no output it will create common data cluster 
and as machine learning engineer we will label those clusters
